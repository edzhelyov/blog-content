    "body": "Hey Tomas first of all great blog you have created here. Instead of reading the bytes in a loop, I would recommend setting the bytes with `bytets.set(data,0)` and to read the bytes into the data I would recommend `data.set(bytes.slice(0, data.length))`. This will increase the performance. Have you perhaps evaluated whether there is an even faster way to pass the imageData to the WebAssembly code?",

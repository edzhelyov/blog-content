<p>
Everyone knows the operation systems package manager like&nbsp;<em>dpkg </em>(from Debian) or&nbsp;<em>RPM Package Manager</em> (from RedHat).</p>
<p>Sometimes there is a need of such a management system in our own use.</p>
<p>The environment doesn't have to be an operation system, but for instance a<strong>&nbsp;web server</strong> or just a <strong>container application</strong>.</p>
<p>The manager must be able to manage package <strong>dependencies</strong>, <strong>versions </strong>and <strong>installation </strong>to the environment system.</p>

<p>All the information must be contained only inside the application itself, the system nor the manage <strong>must not</strong> have any additional data about a concrete package.</p>
<p>To distinguish between a package and a package manager we will use in our context terms <em>Application Package</em> (<strong>AP</strong>) and <em>Application Package Manager</em> (<strong>APM</strong>).</p>
<h2><em>Scenario One</em>: Container Application</h2>
<p>We want to develop a container application which on the starup checks the application folder and install included application if not installed yet.</p>
<p>Consider an application which simulates an operation system. It has a core, folder for configuration, run and so one. In the simplest case:</p>
<pre>/applications/
/system/
       /conf/
            /applications.conf
       /core/
            /lib/
                /apm.jar
                /system.jar
            /apm.xml
       /data/
       /start.bat</pre>
<p>The file <code>conf/applications.conf</code> contains pairs of <code>application-name=files-in-bin-directory-comma-separated</code>. It's empty with a brand new system installation or contains some initial system-provided application and files.</p>
<p>The system calls the APM (<code>core/apm.xml</code>) after the <code>start.bat</code> script is executed. The APM takes care of the applications installation. Then a system program (from the library <code>core/lib/system.jar</code>) goes thru the <code>conf/application.conf</code> and run each application logic (in our case only prints the content of a file defined by the application).</p>
<p>The <code>applications</code> directory stands outside the <code>system</code> directory, it means even when the system is completely updated remains the <code>applications</code> directory untouched and the included application are always ready for a new installation by the next startup.</p>
<h3>AP Implementation</h3>
<p>An AP is nothing more than a folder with a strict defined structure containing all the needed system-related information about itselft. We will put all the AP-related files into the <code>META-INF</code> sub-folder.</p>
<p>Every AP must have a meta information file. We will create a ordinary property file and call it <code>meta.info</code>. The meta information file contains the <em>name</em>, <em>version </em>and <em>dependencies </em>(optionally) of the AP.</p>
<p>For our example we need data to be executed (their content will be printed after the system start). We will put them into <code>data</code> folder.&nbsp;</p>
<pre>META-INF/
        /data/
        /meta.info
</pre>
<p>For an application to be deployed must be the application folder named in the pattern name-version (e.g. code>MySuperAppA-1.0</code>) and placed in the <code>applications</code> folder. This is the default place for the APM to look for the new APs.</p>
<h4>Demo APs&nbsp;</h4>
<p>For the test purposes let's create three APs: <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code> with the following dependencies:</p>
<pre>A --&gt; B, C
B --&gt; C
C --&gt; (no dependency)</pre>
<p>Each AP has two text files called be the pattern ap-name-1.txt and ap-name-2.txt with the content of the name of the AP and number of the data file.</p>
<p>For example the AP named <code>B</code> contains in the folder <code>META-INF/data</code> a file <code>B-1.txt</code> with the content &quot;<code>B1</code>&quot; and a file <code>B-2.txt</code> with the content &quot;<code>B2</code>&quot;.</span></p>
<p>After start of the demo system, we should see the following output:</p>
<pre>C1
C2
B1
B2
A1
A2&nbsp;</pre>
<p>The order of the startups follows the dependencies definitions of the APs.</p>
<h3>APM Implementation</h3>
<p>First of all we need two Ant task for our APM script. The implementation of both is in the <code>core/lib/apm.jar</code> Java library and could be found in the source codes under the <code>ant-lib</code> project.</p>
<h4>Dependencies order</h4>
<p>This task takes a path as a parameter, goes thru this directory and gets all the folders inside it as an input.</p>
<p>Then goes thru all of them and checks the dependencies from the <code>META-INF/meta.info</code>. So it creates a list of dependencies in the order of the need. For each application in the list a sequence inside the task will be executed. The sequence defines the installation procedure.</p>
<pre class="brush: xml">&lt;taskdef name="dependencies-order" classname="cz.net21.ttulka.apm.ant.demo.DependenciesOrderTask"
         classpath="core/lib/apm.jar" /&gt;
...
&lt;dependencies-order path="../applications" relpathmetainfofile="META-INF/meta.info"&gt;
    &lt;sequential&gt;
        &lt;antcall target="install-app"&gt;
            &lt;param name="appPath" value="@{application}" /&gt;
        &lt;/antcall&gt;
    &lt;/sequential&gt;
&lt;/dependencies-order&gt;
</pre>
<h4>Configuration record&nbsp;</h4>
<p>For every application we need to scan the <code>data</code> folder and create a list of the files inside. This list in comma-separated form will be appended into the applications configuration file.</p>
<pre class="brush: xml">&lt;taskdef name="create-conf-record" classname="cz.net21.ttulka.apm.ant.demo.CreateConfRecordTask"
         classpath="core/lib/apm.jar" /&gt;
...
&lt;create-conf-record path="${appPath}/META-INF/data"&gt;
    &lt;sequential&gt;
        &lt;antcall target="write-conf-record"&gt;
            &lt;param name="record" value="@{record}" /&gt;
        &lt;/antcall&gt;
    &lt;/sequential&gt;
&lt;/create-conf-record&gt;
...
&lt;target name="write-conf-record"&gt;
    &lt;echo file="conf/applications.conf" append="true"&gt;${line.separator}${appName}=${record}&lt;/echo&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;&nbsp;</pre>
<p> </p>
<h2><em>Scenario Two</em>: Application (Web) Server&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Such a APM could be used in the same way in the case of installing <strong>web applications into a server</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider that the applications provide some functional services and their installation is <strong>dependent on one or more other</strong>.</p>
<p>We can also install <strong>more versions of an application</strong> and enable only the latest version.</p>
<p>For a proper run of an application the <strong>server needs to be configurated</strong> in a way known only to the application self.</p>
<p>Application must be corretly <strong>re-installed after an update of the server</strong>, even when the old server data was completely removed.</p>
<p>Even here helps the APM in all the above mentioned cases.&nbsp;</p>
